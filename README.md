# Pokedex

Welcome to my Pokedex React/Typescript application.

# Setup

`npm i` is all that's needed prior to starting the application with `npm run start`.

# Testing

Due to time constraints, unit & automation testing is not present in this application. For unit tests, I would use jest and enzyme to test any function I've written. Cypress would be used for automation testing to click through various functionalities to test happy and sad paths.

# Other notes

I did not use React 18 on this project due to issues around JSX elements not being allowed to have more than one child element. Through research, it seems this is a frequently complained about changed without obvious solutions at this time. I am totally unfamiliar with all things Pokemon, but created what looks like an old school Pokedex.
